# Windows 10 Optimization
A guide on how to get more out of Windows 10. Mainly for me to use when setting up new win10 computers.

**NOT RECCOMENDED FOR LAPTOPS**

# DISCLAIMER
Results cannot be guarunteed. Proceed with caution. Always have a restore point in case things go wrong. I am not responsible for any damage caused to your system or files.

# What to expect
* 30-40 Windows Processes 
*  1-2% CPU Usage (Tested on i5-8250u)
* More stable FPS, lower input lag 
* Less tracking (Linux is still WAY better with this)
* Lower input lag in games (Not super noticeable, no false promises. Maybe I'm just not good enough lolol)

# Disable Antivirus
* It's in the name. Not necessary
# BCDEdit and system timers
Put these commands in a cmd (admin) window.

`bcdedit /set disabledynamictick yes`

`bcdedit /set useplatformtick yes`

# Power Plan
Paste in a cmd (admin)

`powercfg -duplicatescheme e9a42b02-d5df-448d-aa00-03f14749eb61`

Honestly use whatever power plan you want

# Memory Cleaners
I don't use one, because I have 16gb of ram. The only one I know of is ISLC, and it seems to be disliked by the tweaking community.

# Custom ISO's
* If you thought this was too much work, here are 2 very nice custom iso's that get all the work done for you. GG has better performance, but I prefer Revi because I play Phasmophobia sometimes
